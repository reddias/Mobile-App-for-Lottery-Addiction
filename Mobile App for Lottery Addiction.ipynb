    "In this project we will be contributing to the development of a mobile app by writing some functions that are mainly focused on probability calculation. By helping people to better estimate their chances of winning, the app aims to both prevent and treat lottery addiction.\n",

    "A medical institute that specializes in treating gambling addiction came up with the idea for the app. The institute already has an engineering team to build the app, however, it needs us to create the logical core of the app and do the probability calculations. For the first version of the app, the institute wants us to focus on the 6/49 lotto and create functions that can answer the following questions for users:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Given a single ticket, what is the probability of winning the big prize?\n",
    "* If we play 40 different tickets (or any other number), what is the probability of winning the big prize?\n",
    "* How likely are we to get at least five (or four or three) winning numbers on one ticket?\n",
    "* The scenario we'll be following throughout this project is fictional - the main purpose is to practice the application of probability and combinatorics (permutations and combinations) concepts in a setting that simulates a real-world scenario."
